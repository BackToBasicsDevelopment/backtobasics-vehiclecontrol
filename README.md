## BackToBasics-VehicleControl

Here is our first release on these forums. We spent a little bit of time developing this simple, standalone menu for your vehicle controls.

Our system is intuitive and currently contains the following features:

• Vehicle Saving
• Driver/Passenger Window Rolling
• Alarm System [WIP]
• Lock System [WIP]
•Door Controls
•Engine toggle
This project is currently at a stage whereby we are happy to share it with the community, but in no way shape or form are we happy to call it complete, you can expect further updates to this system in the future.

# Usage & Controls

U - If pressed when inside a vehicle, vehicle will be saved to the player. If pressed again will toggle the menu.
P - If pressed when inside a vehicle, will toggle vehicle's engine state (On/Off)

# Installation

Place the vehiclecontrol folder into your resources directory. Add start vehiclecontrol to your server.cfg

We hope you enjoy our first release. We hope to bring much more content to the community in time.
